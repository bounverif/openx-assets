= OpenX Assets

This repository provides a development environment and a curated collection of simulation assets aligned with the ASAM OpenX standards:
link:https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive/[OpenDrive],
link:https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/openscenario-xml/[OpenScenario XML],
link:https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/openmaterial/[OpenMaterial3D], and
link:https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/osi/[OpenSimulationInterface].

The simulation assets are originally designed for use with link:https://esmini.github.io/[esmini], a lightweight and modular OpenSCENARIO XML simulator, suitable for rapid prototyping, testing, and integration workflows. Future releases will target conformance with the link:https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/openmaterial/[OpenMATERIAL 3D] specification, while maintaining compatibility with the OpenSceneGraph (OSG) formats for Esmini support.

If you find this project valuable, please consider *sponsoring our open-source work*. We especially encourage *commercial users* to show their support if they benefit from these assets.

== Blender Extension Package for Asset Development

This repository includes a basic Blender extension package designed to streamline the creation and validation of simulation assets compliant with ASAM OpenX standards.

To install the extension on a typical Linux environment, create a symbolic link to the Python package within Blender’s default user extensions repository (named `user_default`) as follows:

[source, bash]
----
ln -s ${PWD}/python/openx_assets ${BLENDER_USER_RESOURCES}/extensions/user_default/
----

Here, `BLENDER_USER_RESOURCES` typically points to the Blender configuration directory, usually located at `$HOME/.config/blender` on Linux. This location may change depending on your Blender distribution source. Please follow Blender guides for installing the extension for other environments.

== GLTF Format

GLTF is the primary interchange format used in this repository for 3D assets due to its efficiency, interoperability, and extensibility. It supports:

- Compact, runtime-optimized binary encoding (`.glb`) for deployment
- Human-readable JSON-based structure (`.gltf`) for inspection and easy tooling
- Native integration with modern rendering engines and web-based visualizers

GLTF is the preferred format for all assets in this repository and serves as the reference format for standards compliance, quality assurance, and downstream integration workflows.

== FBX and OSG Formats

While GLTF is the preferred format, the repository also maintains compatibility with:

- *FBX*: Supported primarily for compatibility with other simulation and asset conversion workflows.
- *OSGB*: Native format for the Esmini simulator. Assets exported in `.osgb` format from the FBX assets can be used directly in Esmini simulation runtime.

Support for these formats ensures backward compatibility and smooth transition paths from existing asset libraries to OpenX-compliant environments.

NOTE: Due to licensing restrictions, we cannot distribute the Autodesk FBX SDK, which is needed to convert `.fbx` models into `.osgb`. However, you can install the plugin inside the devcontainer using the script at `/usr/local/bin/fbxsdk-install.sh`.
